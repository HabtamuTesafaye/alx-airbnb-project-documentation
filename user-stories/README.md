# 📘 Airbnb Clone – User Stories

## 🧩 What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability — usually a user or customer of the system. They are the foundation of modern agile development and help teams understand **what to build** and **why it matters**.

Each user story follows this format:

> "As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so that [I can achieve a goal]."

## 🎯 Purpose of This Document

This directory contains **user stories** derived from the official use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend project. These stories represent real-world actions and needs from different roles interacting with the system and serve as a guide for backend feature planning, API design, and testing.

By writing these user stories:
- We bridge the gap between technical features and user expectations.
- We ensure the system provides value to all intended roles.
- We clarify the scope and flow of user interactions.

## 👥 Covered User Roles

The stories are organized by role:

- **Guest**  
  Users who search, register, and book properties on the platform.

- **Host**  
  Users who create, manage, and respond to listings and bookings.

- **Admin**  
  System operators responsible for moderation, oversight, payments, and user management.

## 🔍 How These Stories Were Developed

These stories were written based on the **use case diagram** created in Task 1. Each interaction in the diagram (e.g., "Book Property", "Respond to Reviews", "User Management") has been translated into one or more user stories to ensure full feature coverage.

This approach ensures:
- Traceability from visual requirements to implementation
- Easy communication between non-technical stakeholders and developers
- Readiness for creating acceptance criteria or test cases
